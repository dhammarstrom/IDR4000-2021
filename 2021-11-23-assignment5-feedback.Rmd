## Structure your analysis

- Structure your folder in a way that makes you, and collaborator understand what is going on! If you have a complex project, use the `README.md` file to explain your project folder (and possibly the project).
- Delete or move unused and old files to another sub-folder. 

### `report.Rmd`
- A report source-file should be placed in the main folder. This will make the Rmd-file use the same folder system as in your project.
- The report can be knitted to another directory if you wish (in YAML: `output_dir: "./output". Rememeber to create the folder).
- If the report contains a lot of heavy computations, R-scripts can be used to structure your analysis and creatons of figures. Put all your scripts in specific folder to keep track.

### R
- Gather all `.R` files in one folder, potentially with sub-folders. These should be named according to what they are doing (e.g. table-1.R).

### Figures
- If you are creating figures separately from the report.Rmd file, structure this folder containing numbered figures. You could add a `README.md` also in this folder to explain the files further. 

## A proposed file structure

A large project (using R) could be structured like this:

```
project
|  README.md
|  report.Rmd
|
|--- resources
|   | references.bib
|   | style_template.docx
|
|--- data
|   | example-data.xlsx
|   | --- derived-data
|   |   | models.RDS
|   |   | dataset.RDS
|
|--- R
|   | script-1.R
|   | script-descriptive-name.R
|
|--- figures
|   | figure-1.R
|   | figure-1.pdf
|
|--- scraps
|   | old-file-1.R

```

## Comment your code
- ALWAYS(!) comment your code with your **intentions** to explain why the code looks the way it does. This will help your collaborator and yourself.
- In large scripts try to add a commented section describing the purpose of the code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Table 1.
# Purpose: Summarize data and structure Table 1 (participant characteristics).
# Include Sex, weight, height


# load libraries 

# ...
```

- Use comments to plan your analyzes and code. Write a plan before you proceed with coding.


## Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics

- Think about what you are trying to show, and what you are able to show with your data. In the one- vs. three-set training study time-effects are not interesting in an inferential perspective, **why**?
- Descriptive statistics can be shown with e.g. mean and SD, raw data in figures or summarized data in tables.
- Inferential statistics are shown with confidence intervals, p-values etc. These statistics should be calculated in relation to your question, **why?**



# Workshop 23/11 - Descriptive figures

- In `strengthvolume` and `dxadata`, the natural comparison is between volume conditions. Use `dxadata`or `strengthvolume` data to:
  1. Sketch (pen and paper) a figure showing differences in change scores between volume conditions 
  2. Create a figure based on your sketch showing differences in change scores between volume conditions
