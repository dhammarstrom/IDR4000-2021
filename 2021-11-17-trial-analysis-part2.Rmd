## Hypertrophy and graded protein dose

-   Read Haun et al. [@haun2018] and find the main purpose/aim/hypothesis of the study.
-   How do they motivate their purpose/aim/hypothesis?
-   What is the statistical test used test the main hypotheses?

## Make it simple!

Design an analysis of the data from @haun2018:

-   Include only two time-points (T1 and T3)
-   Select one meassure of muscle hypertrophy
-   Select a test for a null-hypothesis significance test
-   Do your results correspond to what is found in @haun2018?

To get started:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(exscidata); library(tidyverse)
data("hypertrophy")


hypertrophy %>%
  select(PARTICIPANT, GROUP, VL_T1, VL_T2, VL_T3, VL_T4) %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "time", 
               values_to = "thickness", 
               cols = VL_T1:VL_T4) %>%
  group_by(GROUP, time) %>%
  summarise(m = mean(thickness, na.rm = TRUE), 
            s = sd(thickness, na.rm = TRUE)) 
  



```
