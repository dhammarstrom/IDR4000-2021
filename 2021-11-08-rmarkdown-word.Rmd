# Introduction

- Using the MS Word output lets you convert your R Markdown file to a cutomizable word document.
- If we add a template we will be able to change the layout of the document to e.g. fit requirements for an assignment.
- You need to specify a template in your YAML field:

```{r eval = FALSE}

```

- In the template file, headings and ordinary text have been formatted. 
- You can also specify specific formats by adding Styles (Opprett en stil)
- To "activate" the style use `<div custom-style="mystyle">`MY STYLE TEXT`</div>`. This will result in

<div custom-style="mystyle"> MY STYLE TEXT </div>



## Exercises

1. Create a word-template and change the headline styles (font, size and color)
2. Add a custom style to your template and use it from your R Markdown file.
